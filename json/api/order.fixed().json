{"dt-api":{"summary":"Get / set the fixed ordering applied to the table.","description":"This method provides the ability to control the fixed ordering that is applied to a DataTable. The \"fixed\" ordering is a column order that will be applied to a table's ordering before and / or after the user's ordering is applied. Consider for example a table which you wish to always order by column 0, this method (or `dt-init orderFixed`) could be used to apply that fixed order, while the end user would then be able to add their own ordering to the table thanks to DataTables' multi-column ordering.\r\n\r\n\t\tThe fixed ordering can be applied before (`pre`) or after (`post`) the user's own ordering criteria using the two different properties that can be given in the value for this method, when used as a setter.\r\n\r\n\t\tThe values that are used to describe the ordering conditions for the table are given as two element arrays:\r\n\r\n\t\t* Column index to order upon\r\n\t\t* Direction so order to apply (`-string asc` for ascending order or `-string desc` for descending order).\r\n\r\n\t\tIt is also possible to give a set of nested arrays (i.e. arrays in arrays) to allow multi-column ordering to be assigned.","name":"order.fixed()","example":{"content":"\r\nvar table = $('#example').DataTable();\r\n\r\ntable.order.fixed( {\r\n\tpre: [ 0, 'asc' ]\r\n} );\r\n","title":"Set the fixed ordering of the table"},"since":"1.10.10","type":[{"description":"Get the fixed ordering that is applied to the table.
