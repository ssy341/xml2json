{"dt-api":{"summary":"Order the table by the selected column.","description":"This method provides a useful alternative to the `dt-api order()` method, allowing you to select the column that you want to be ordered using the flexible `dt-api column()` selector and having it ordered in the direction specified.\r\n\r\n\t\tNote that if the selector used for `dt-api column()` matches more than one column, the result will be truncated to a single column. To perform multi-column ordering, please use `dt-api columns().order()` or `dt-api order()`.\r\n\r\n\t\tPlease be aware that this method sets the ordering to apply to the table - it does not actually perform the order. In order to have the order performed, use the `dt-api draw()` method, which can be called simply as a chained method of the `dt-api order()` method's returned object - for example `table.order([0, 'desc']).draw();`.","name":"column().order()","example":{"content":"\r\nvar table = $('#example').DataTable();\r\n\r\ntable\r\n\t.column( '0:visible' )\r\n\t.order( 'asc' )\r\n\t.draw();\r\n","title":"Sort by the first visible column"},"since":"1.10","type":{"parameter":{"content":"Direction of sort to apply to the selected column - `dt-string desc` (descending) or `dt-string asc` (ascending).","name":"direction","type":"string"},"description":"Order the table, in the direction specified, by the column selected by the `dt-api column()` selector.","returns":{"content":"DataTables API instance","type":"DataTables.Api"},"type":"function","signature":"column().order( direction )"},"group":"columns","related":[{"content":"order","type":"option"},{"content":"ordering","type":"option"},{"content":"order()","type":"api"},{"content":"columns().order()","type":"api"}]}}
