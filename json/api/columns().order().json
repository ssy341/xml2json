{"dt-api":{"summary":"Order the table by the selected columns.","description":"This method provides a useful alternative to the `dt-api order()` method, allowing you to select the columns that you want to be ordered using the flexible `dt-api columns()` selector and having them ordered in the direction specified.\r\n\r\n\t\tMulti-column ordering is achieved by ensuring that the column selector matches multiple columns (single column ordering is performed if only one column is matched, or by using the `dt-api column().order()` method). The order of the matched columns defines the priority sequence in which the ordering of the table is applied.\r\n\r\n\t\tPlease be aware that this method sets the ordering to apply to the table - it does not actually perform the order. In order to have the order performed, use the `dt-api draw()` method, which can be called simply as a chained method of the `dt-api order()` method's returned object - for example `table.order([0, 'desc']).draw();`.","name":"columns().order()","example":{"content":"\r\nvar table = $('#example').DataTable();\r\n\r\ntable\r\n\t.columns( '.status' )\r\n\t.order( 'desc' )\r\n\t.draw();\r\n","title":"Sort by all columns with the class '.status'"},"since":"1.10","type":{"parameter":{"content":"Direction of sort to apply to the selected columns - `dt-string desc` (descending) or `dt-string asc` (ascending).
