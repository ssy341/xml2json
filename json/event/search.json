{"dt-event":{"summary":"Search event - fired when the table is filtered.","description":"The `dt-event search` event is fired whenever the table's searching is triggered by the global search or columns search options, including calls from the API (`dt-api search()` for example). Additionally, a full redraw (by calling the `dt-api draw()`) method will cause the table to be re-searched.\r\n\r\n\t\tNote that the `dt-event search` will be fired before the table has been redrawn with the updated filtered data, although the data will internally have been filtered.\r\n\r\n\t\tPlease note that, as with all DataTables emitted events, this event is triggered with the `dt` namespace. As such, to listen for this event, you must also use the `dt` namespace by simply appending `.dt` to your event name, as shown in the example below.","name":"search","example":{"content":"\r\nvar table = $('#example').DataTable();\r\n\r\ntable.on( 'search.dt', function () {\r\n\t$('#filterInfo').html( 'Currently applied global search: '+table.search() );\r\n} );\r\n","title":"Update an external input with filtering information using the API"},"since":"1.10","type":{"scope":"HTML table element","parameter":[{"content":"jQuery event object","name":"e","type":"object"},{"content":"DataTables settings object","name":"settings","type":"DataTables.Settings"}],"type":"function","signature":"function( e, settings )"},"related":[{"content":"searching","type":"option"},{"content":"search","type":"option"},{"content":"columns.searchable","type":"option"},{"content":"draw()","type":"api"},{"content":"search()","type":"api"},{"content":"column().search()","type":"api"},{"content":"columns().search()","type":"api"}]}}
