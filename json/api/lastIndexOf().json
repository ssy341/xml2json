{"dt-api":{"summary":"Find the last instance of a value in the API instance's result set.","description":"It is often very useful to know if a value is in a result set, and further, what its position is in the result set if it is present. This method provides exactly that ability, searching for the value given, starting from the last item in the instance's result set and working back thought the result set (see `dt-api indexOf()` to search for the first instance of a value) and giving its position in the result set.\r\n\r\n\t\tThis method makes use of the fact that DataTables API objects are \"array like\", in that they inherent a lot of the abilities and methods of the Javascript `Array` type.\r\n\r\n\t\tIn this case, this method is a proxy for the Javascript `Array.prototype.lastIndexOf` method and is provided as a utility method for the DataTables API. For more information about the original method, please refer to the [Mozilla MDN documentation for `lastIndexOf`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/lastIndexOf).
