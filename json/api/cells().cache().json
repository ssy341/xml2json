{"dt-api":{"summary":"Get the DataTables cached data for the selected cells","description":"DataTables caches data for searching and ordering in order for those operations to run as quickly as possible when they are required. Sometimes it can be useful to get the data that DataTables has cached for these operations, for example when creating a `select` list to provide a column based filter.\r\n\r\n\t\tCached data is not guaranteed to be available at any particular moment. If DataTables hasn't requested the data, it won't have been cached. This is particularly obvious when using the `-string order` option and a sort hasn't been performed on a column. Invalidation of data will also cause the cache to be removed.\r\n\r\n\t\tIt should be noted that this method is required as DataTables has the ability to use different data for its different operations (searching, ordering, display etc) - see `dt-init columns.data` and `dt-init columns.render` for further information. `dt-api cells().data()` provides access to the original data. If you aren't using orthogonal data for the different operations of DataTables, then this method is of limited used.\r\n\r\n\t\tNote that this method is primarily aimed at plug-in developers who require access to the internal data that DataTables has stored.","name":"cells().cache()","example":{"content":"\r\nvar table = $('#example').DataTable();\r\n\r\n// Create the select list and search operation\r\nvar select = $('<select />')\r\n\t.appendTo( 'body' )\r\n\t.on( 'change', function () {\r\n\t\ttable\r\n\t\t\t.column( 0 )\r\n\t\t\t.search( $(this).val() )\r\n\t\t\t.draw();\r\n\t} );\r\n\r\n// Get the search data for the first column and add to the select list\r\nvar data = table\r\n\t.cells( '', 0 )\r\n\t.cache( 'search' )\r\n\t.sort()\r\n\t.unique()\r\n\t.each( function ( d ) {\r\n\t\tselect.append( $('<option value=\"'+d+'\">'+d+'<\/option>') );\r\n\t} );\r\n","title":"Build a filtering select list using the data from a single column"},"since":"1.10","type":{"parameter":{"content":"Specify which cache the data should be read from.
