{"dt-event":{"summary":"Initialisation started event - triggered immediately before data load.","description":"This event is emitted by DataTables when a table is being initialised and is about to request data. At the point of being fired the table will have its columns and features initialised, but no data will have been loaded (either by Ajax, or reading from the DOM).\r\n\r\n\t\tIts primary purpose is to allow authors of extensions to DataTables be add a listener to the document so some action can be taken before data is loaded (for example modifying the amount of data to be loaded).\r\n\r\n\t\tPlease note that, as with all DataTables emitted events, this event is triggered with the `dt` namespace. As such, to listen for this event, you must also use the `dt` namespace by simply appending `.dt` to your event name, as shown in the example below.","name":"preInit","bubbles":true,"example":{"content":"\r\n\r\n$(document).on( 'preInit.dt', function (e, settings) {\r\n\tvar api = new $.fn.dataTable.Api( settings );\r\n\r\n\tapi.page.len( 20 );\r\n} );\r\n\r\n$('#example').DataTable();\r\n\t\r\n","title":"Set the data length to display to be 20 items"},"since":"1.10.8","type":{"scope":"HTML table element","parameter":[{"content":"jQuery event object","name":"e","type":"object"},{"content":"DataTables settings object","name":"settings","type":"DataTables.Settings"}],"type":"function","signature":"function( e, settings )"},"related":["dt-init initComplete","dt-event init"]}}
