{"dt-api":{"summary":"Delete the selected rows from the DataTable.","description":"This method (and its singular counterpart, `dt-api row().remove()`) removes the selected rows from the DataTable completely, deleting the allocated memory for data and nodes from the browser.\r\n\r\n\t\tPlease be aware that this method removes the data from the table internally but that action won't be visually shown until the  `dt-api draw()` method is called to update the display. This method can called simply as a chained method of the `dt-api rows().remove()` method's returned object - for example `table.rows().remove().draw();`. This method is used to reduce the number of draws required if multiple rows are being deleted for optimisation.","name":"rows().remove()","example":[{"content":"\r\nvar table = $('#example').DataTable();\r\n\r\nvar rows = table\r\n\t.rows( '.selected' )\r\n\t.remove()\r\n\t.draw();\r\n","title":"Delete all rows with the class `selected` from the table"},{"content":"\r\nvar table = $('#example').DataTable();\r\n\r\nvar rows = table\r\n\t.rows()\r\n\t.remove()\r\n\t.draw();\r\n","title":"Remove all rows from a table (this is the same effect as using `dt-api clear()`"}],"since":"1.10","type":{"description":"Delete the selected rows.","returns":{"content":"DataTables API instance.","type":"DataTables.Api"},"type":"function","signature":"rows().remove()"},"group":"rows","related":[{"content":"row().remove()","type":"api"},{"content":"clear()","type":"api"}]}}
