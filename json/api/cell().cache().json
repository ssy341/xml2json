{"dt-api":{"summary":"Get the DataTables cached data for the selected cell","description":"DataTables caches data for searching and ordering in order for those operations to run as quickly as possible when they are required. Sometimes it can be useful to get the data that DataTables has cached for these operations, access to which is provided by this method.\r\n\r\n\t\tCached data is not guaranteed to be available at any particular moment. If DataTables hasn't requested the data, it won't have been cached. This is particularly obvious when using the `-string order` option and a sort hasn't been performed on a column. Invalidation of data will also cause the cache to be removed.\r\n\r\n\t\tIt should be noted that this method is required as DataTables has the ability to use different data for its different operations (searching, ordering, display etc) - see `dt-init columns.data` and `dt-init columns.render` for further information. `dt-api cell().data()` provides access to the original data. If you aren't using orthogonal data for the different operations of DataTables, then this method is of limited used.\r\n\r\n\t\tNote that this method is primarily aimed at plug-in developers who require access to the internal data that DataTables has stored.","name":"cell().cache()","example":{"content":"\r\nvar table = $('#example').DataTable();\r\n\r\n$('#example tbody').on( 'click', 'td', function () {\r\n\talert( table.cell( this ).cache( 'order' ) );\r\n} );\r\n","title":"Alert the "},"since":"1.10","type":{"parameter":{"content":"Specify which cache the data should be read from.
