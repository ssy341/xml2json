{"dt-option":{"summary":"Number formatting callback function.","default":"Shows numbers grouped as thousands with a comma separator","description":"DataTables will display numbers in a few different locations when drawing information about a table, for example in the table's information element and the pagination controls. When working with large numbers it is often useful to format it for readability by separating the thousand units - for example 1 million is rendered as \"1,000,000\", allowing the user to see at a glance what order of magnitude the number shows.\r\n\r\n\t\tThis function allows complete control over how that formatting is performed. By default DataTables will use the character specified in `dt-init language.thousands` (in turn, that, by default, is a comma) as the thousands separator.","name":"formatNumber","example":{"content":"\r\n$('#example').dataTable( {\r\n  \"formatNumber\": function ( toFormat ) {\r\n    return toFormat.toString().replace(\r\n      /\\B(?=(\\d{3})+(?!\\d))/g, \"'\"\r\n    );\r\n  };\r\n} );\r\n","title":"Show large numbers with a `'` separator"},"since":"1.10","type":{"scope":"HTML table element","parameter":{"content":"Number to be formatted","name":"formatNumber","type":"integer"},"returns":{"content":"Formatted string for DataTables to show the number","type":"string"},"type":"function","signature":"formatNumber( toFormat )"},"group":"callback","related":[{"content":"language.info","type":"option"},{"content":"language.thousands","type":"option"},{"content":"infoCallback","type":"option"}]}}
