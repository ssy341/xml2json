		<param type="string" name="version">
			Version string to check for, in the format "X.Y.Z". Note that the formats "X" and "X.Y" are also acceptable.

		<returns type="boolean">`true` if this version of DataTables is greater or equal to the required version, or `false` if this version of DataTales is not suitable</returns>

	<description>
		This method provides the ability for plug-in developers to check a required version number against the running version of DataTables. For example, a plug-in such as [Buttons](/extensions/buttons) might require DataTables 1.10.7 or newer. This method provides the ability to check that.

		Please note that this is a **static** function and is accessed through the `$.fn.dataTable` object, not an API instance. It can be accessed at any time, even before any DataTables have been created on the page.
