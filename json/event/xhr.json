{"dt-event":{"summary":"Ajax event - fired when an Ajax request is completed","description":"When working with Ajax data, it is often useful to know when DataTables has completed the loading of data, so you can either manipulate that data into the format DataTables expects based upon its configuration (`dt-init columns.data`) or so you can use the data contained in the JSON response from the server for other parts of the page.\r\n\r\n\t\tThis event can be seen as the event compliment to the `dt-init ajax.dataSrc` option (which can also be used to manipulate and intercept the data from the Ajax request). Generally you would want to do data manipulation in the `dataSrc` callback and use events for intercepting the data.\r\n\r\n\t\tNote that this event is called before DataTables has processed the new data from the server, so the returned data will not have been drawn on page when this event fires.\r\n\r\n\t\tAdditionally, as of DataTables 1.10.7 this event is triggered by both success and error conditions when the Ajax request completed (i.e. it is always triggered regardless of the outcome of the Ajax request). Prior to 1.10.7 it was only triggered by a successful request. The `json` parameter (3th passed in) for the event handler will be `null` if an error has occurred and the `xhr` parameter (4th) can be used to determine the error details if required.\r\n\r\n\t\tPlease note that, as with all DataTables emitted events, this event is triggered with the `dt` namespace. As such, to listen for this event, you must also use the `dt` namespace by simply appending `.dt` to your event name, as shown in the example below.","name":"xhr","example":[{"content":"\r\n$('#example')\r\n\t.on('xhr.dt', function ( e, settings, json, xhr ) {\r\n\t\tfor ( var i=0, ien=json.aaData.length ; i<ien ; i++ ) {\r\n\t\t\tjson.aaData[i].sum = json.aaData[i].one + json.aaData[i].two;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t// Note no return - manipulate the data directly in the JSON object.\r\n\t} )\r\n\t.dataTable( {\r\n\t\tajax: \"data.json\"\r\n\t} );\r\n","title":"Pre-process the data returned from the server"},{"content":"\r\n$('#example')\r\n\t.on('xhr.dt', function ( e, settings, json, xhr ) {\r\n\t\t$('#status').html( json.status );\r\n\t} )\r\n\t.dataTable( {\r\n\t\tajax: \"data.json\"\r\n\t} );\r\n\r\n","title":"Use a custom property returned from the server in another DOM element"}],"since":"1.10","type":{"scope":"HTML table element","parameter":[{"content":"jQuery event object","name":"e","type":"object"},{"content":"DataTables settings object","name":"settings","type":"DataTables.Settings"},{"content":"Data returned from the server.
