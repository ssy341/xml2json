{"dt-api":{"summary":"Iterate over the contents of the API result set.","description":"This method makes use of the fact that DataTables API objects are \"array like\", in that they inherent a lot of the abilities and methods of the Javascript `Array` type.\r\n\r\n\t\tNote that when working with the plural methods such as `dt-api rows()` and `dt-api columns()` you may wish to use the `dt-api rows().every()`, `dt-api columns().every()` and `dt-api cells().every()` methods to iterate over each row, column or cell with the context set to that table element. This might sound a little complicated, but it can significantly simplify your code! Please refer to the documentation for each of the `every` methods for full details.\r\n\r\n\t\tThe `dt-api each()` method is a proxy for the Javascript `Array.prototype.forEach` method and is provided as a utility method for the DataTables API. For more information about the original method, please refer to the [Mozilla MDN documentation for `forEach`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach). In browsers which do not support `forEach` natively, a polyfill is provided to allow this DataTables method to operate as expected.","name":"each()","example":{"content":"\r\nvar table = $('#example').DataTable();\r\n\r\ntable\r\n\t.column( 0 )\r\n\t.data()\r\n\t.each( function ( value, index ) {\r\n\t\tconsole.log( 'Data in index: '+index+' is: '+value );\r\n\t} );\r\n\r\n","title":"Loop over the data from a column"},"since":"1.10","type":{"parameter":{"content":"Callback function which is called for each item in the API instance result set.
