			* `true` - Append a hash (`#`) to the start of each row id. This can be useful for then using the ids as selectors
			* `false` - Do not modify the id value.

	<description>
		This method can be used to get the id's of the rows selected by the `dt-api rows()` method, as specified by the row's data and the `dt-init rowId` option. Optionally it can also prepend a hash (`#`) to the ids allowing them to then easily be used as selectors.

		**Important** This method does not read the DOM id for the `-tag tr` elements, but rather gets the row id from the row's data source (location specified by `dt-init rowId`).
