Although Bootstrap, Foundation and other libraries require a plug-in, jQuery UI ThemeRoller support is built into DataTables and can be enabled simply with this parameter. When enabled, DataTables will use markup and classes created for jQuery UI ThemeRoller, making it very easy to integrate your tables with jQuery UI.\r\n\r\n\t\tWhen enabled, you will likely want to load the `jquery.dataTables_themeroller.css` file that is included in the DataTables package (`path media/css`) as ThemeRoller does not provide all of the styles needed by DataTables.\r\n\r\n\t\tNote that this feature is deprecated in DataTables 1.10 and will be removed in 1.11, where upon this feature will be provided by plug-ins, matching the other style libraries.
