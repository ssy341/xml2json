{"dt-api":{"summary":"Find the first instance of a value in the API instance's result set.","description":"It is often very useful to know if a value is in a result set, and further, what its position is in the result set if it is present. This method provides exactly that ability, searching for the value given, starting from index 0 (see `dt-api lastIndexOf()` for starting at the end of the array) and giving its position in the result set.\r\n\r\n\t\tThis method makes use of the fact that DataTables API objects are \"array like\", in that they inherent a lot of the abilities and methods of the Javascript `Array` type.\r\n\r\n\t\tIn this case, this method is a proxy for the Javascript `Array.prototype.indexOf` method and is provided as a utility method for the DataTables API. For more information about the original method, please refer to the [Mozilla MDN documentation for `indexOf`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf). In browsers which do not support `indexOf` natively, a polyfill is provided to allow this DataTables method to operate as expected.","name":"indexOf()","example":{"content":"\r\nvar table = $('#example').DataTable();\r\n\r\nvar index = table\r\n\t.column( 0 )\r\n\t.data()\r\n\t.indexOf( 21 );\r\n\r\nif ( index < 0 ) {\r\n\talert( '21 was not found in the result set' );\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n\talert( '21 was found at index: '+index );\r\n}\r\n\r\n","title":"Find an item in a column of data"},"since":"1.10","type":{"parameter":{"content":"Value to find in the instance's result set.","name":"value","type":"*"},"description":"Find the first instance of a value in the API instance's result set.","returns":{"content":"The index of the item in the result set, or -1 if not found.","type":"integer"},"type":"function","signature":"indexOf( value )"},"group":"utility"}}
