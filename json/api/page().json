{"dt-api":{"summary":"Get / set the current page of the table.","description":"Paging is a core feature of DataTables, and this method provides external control over the page which the table is displaying. This can be useful if you want to provide custom paging controls for your table, external to the built-in paging control options or the paging plug-in options.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tNote that if you attempt to show a page which does not exist using the set format of this method, DataTables will not throw an error, but rather reset the paging to the first page.\r\n\r\n\t\tPlease be aware that this method sets the page to be shown - it does not actually perform the re-display of the table. In order to have the newly set page shown use the `dt-api draw()` method, which can be called simply as a chained method of the `dt-api page()` method's returned object - for example `table.page( 0 ).draw( false );`.\r\n\r\n\t\tAdditionally note that you should pass `false` or `-string page` as the first parameter to `dt-api draw()` to have it do a standing redraw. Without this parameter, `dt-api draw()` will do a full draw resulting in the paging being reset back to the first page!","name":"page()","example":{"content":"\r\nvar table = $('#example').DataTable();\r\n\r\n$('#next').on( 'click', function () {\r\n\ttable.page( 'next' ).draw( 'page' );\r\n} );\r\n\r\n$('#previous').on( 'click', function () {\r\n\ttable.page( 'previous' ).draw( 'page' );\r\n} );\r\n","title":"Custom paging controls for next / previous pages"},"since":"1.10","type":[{"description":"Get the current page of the table.
