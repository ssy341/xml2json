{"dt-type":{"summary":"Javascript `Object` type","description":"\r\n\r\nJavascript's native `Object` type is used to create sets of information, containing data of any Javascript data type. Objects are created using: `{}` or `new Object()`.\r\n\r\nA detailed description of the `Array` type is available on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Use in DataTables\r\n\r\nWhere a parameter is shown as accepting an object type, or a method returning an object type, it indicates that a native `object` is expected / returned.\r\n\r\nNote that typically the objects used by DataTables will be of the _plain object_ (`{}`) variety, particularly when working with data sets to display in the table, however, Javascript also treats object instances created by the `new` keyword as objects. DataTables will also accept object instances where `object` is shown as the data type.\r\n\r\n\t","name":"object","group":"js"}}
