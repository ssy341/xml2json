Child rows can be attached using `dt-api row().child()` but do not have to be made immediately visible. This method provides the option of making those child rows which have already been attached visible.\r\n\r\n\t\tUnlike many of the other methods which manipulate the DataTable, this method does not require `dt-api draw()` to be called for the resulting change to be displayed.
