{"dt-type":{"summary":"DataTables settings object","description":"\r\n\r\nDataTables stores the configuration and data for each table in a _settings object_. The structure of this object is considered to be **private** in terms of the DataTables API and reading or writing to the values in the object is **not supported**. The property names and values contained within the object can, will and do change between versions!\r\n\r\nBased on the above warning you might be scared off from the object entirely, but actually it can be quite useful. As it contains the information needed to describe a DataTable fully, DataTables will often pass this object into callback methods to provide a description of the table in question which can then be used with an API constructor (see `dt-type DataTables.Api`) to create a new API object for the table. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar api = new $.fn.dataTable.Api( settings );\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above will create an API instance for the table that is referenced by the `settings` object in question.\r\n\r\nConsider a more complete example using `dt-init drawCallback`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$('#example').dataTable( {\r\n\t\"drawCallback\": function( settings ) {\r\n\t\tvar api = new $.fn.dataTable.Api( settings );\r\n\r\n\t\t// Output the data for the visible rows to the browser's console\r\n\t\t// You might do something more useful with it!\r\n\t\tconsole.log( api.rows( {page:'current'} ).data() );\r\n\t}\r\n} );\r\n```\r\n\r\n\t","name":"DataTables.Settings","group":"dt"}}
