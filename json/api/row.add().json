{"dt-api":{"summary":"Add a new row to the table.","description":"Adding new data to a table is central to the concept of being able to dynamically control the content of a DataTable, and this method provides the ability to do exactly that. It will add a single row at a time - for addition of multiple rows, either call this method multiple times, or use this method's plural counterpart: `dt-api rows.add()`.\r\n\r\n\t\tThe rows that are added are subjected to the ordering and search criteria that are applied to the table, which will determine the new row's position and visibility in the table.\r\n\r\n\t\tThis method will add the data to the table internally, but does not visually update the tables display to account for this new data. In order to have the table's display updated, use the `dt-api draw()` method, which can be called simply as a chained method of the `dt-api row.add()` method's returned object - for example `table.row.add( [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] ).draw();`. This is done to allow easy optimisation of the table where multiple rows can be added before the table is redrawn.","name":"row.add()","example":[{"content":"\r\nvar table = $('#example').DataTable();\r\n\r\ntable.row.add( {\r\n\t\t\"name\":       \"Tiger Nixon\",\r\n\t\t\"position\":   \"System Architect\",\r\n\t\t\"salary\":     \"$3,120\",\r\n\t\t\"start_date\": \"2011/04/25\",\r\n\t\t\"office\":     \"Edinburgh\",\r\n\t\t\"extn\":       \"5421\"\r\n\t} ).draw();\r\n","title":"Simply add a new row to the table and redraw"},{"content":"\r\nvar table = $('#example').DataTable();\r\n\r\nvar rowNode = table\r\n\t.row.add( [ 'Fiona White', 32, 'Edinburgh' ] )\r\n\t.draw()\r\n\t.node();\r\n\r\n$( rowNode )\r\n\t.css( 'color', 'red' )\r\n\t.animate( { color: 'black' } );\r\n\r\n","title":"Add a row and get its newly created node to highlight that it was newly added"}],"since":"1.10","type":{"parameter":{"content":"Data to use for the new row.
