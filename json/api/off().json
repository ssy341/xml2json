{"dt-api":{"summary":"Table events removal.","description":"DataTables can trigger a number of events which can be useful for taking action when DataTables performs those events. For example, it is often useful to know when an Ajax event occurs (`dt-event xhr`), so you can add additional data to the JSON payload.\r\n\r\n\t\tDataTables provides three methods for working with DataTables events, matching the core jQuery event methods:\r\n\r\n\t\t* `dt-api on()` - Listen for events\r\n\t\t* `dt-api off()` - Stop listening for events\r\n\t\t* `dt-api one()` - Listen for a single event.\r\n\r\n\t\tThis `dt-api off()` method is used to remove a listener that has already been attached to a DataTables. Simply pass in the event you wish to remove the listener, and optionally the specific function if you want to remove only a single event listener.","name":"off()","example":{"content":"\r\nvar table = $('#example').DataTable( {\r\n\tajax: \"/data\",\r\n\tserverSide: true\r\n} );\r\n\r\ntable.on( 'xhr', function ( e, settings, json ) {\r\n\ttable.off( 'xhr' );\r\n\tconsole.log( 'Ajax event occurred. Returned data: ', json );\r\n} );\r\n\r\n// note that this is the same effect as using `table.one(...);`\r\n","title":"Listen for only the first `dt-event xhr` event from DataTables"},"since":"1.10","type":{"parameter":[{"content":"Event name to remove.
