{"dt-api":{"summary":"Remove the last item from an API instance's result set.","description":"Just as with Javascript arrays', since the DataTables API object is \"array like\", items can be removed from a result set using this method. *Popping* a result, pops it off the end. The API instance's result set is reduced in length by 1 and the item that was removed is returned from the function call. `dt-api shift()` can be used to perform the same action, but at the start of the array, if required.\r\n\r\n\t\tThis method is a proxy for the Javascript `Array.prototype.pop` method and is provided as a utility method for the DataTables API. For more information about the original method, please refer to the [Mozilla MDN documentation for `pop`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop).","name":"pop()","example":{"content":"\r\nvar table = $('#example').DataTable();\r\n\r\nvar data = table\r\n\t.column( 0 )\r\n\t.data();\r\n\r\nvar lastItem = data.pop();\r\n\r\nalert( 'Last item in the result set was: '+lastItem );\r\n\r\n","title":"Get the last item from a column."},"since":"1.10","type":{"description":"Remove the last item from an API instance's result set.","returns":{"content":"Item removed form the result set (was previously the last item in the result set).","type":"*"},"type":"function","signature":"pop()"},"group":"utility"}}
