{"dt-api":{"summary":"Invalidate the data held in DataTables for the selected row","description":"DataTables holds cached information about the contents of each cell in the table to increase performance of table operations such as ordering and searching. If you were to modify the contents of a cell (for DOM data source tables) or the array / object values (for Ajax / JS source tables) DataTables wouldn't know that this has happened. This method can be used to tell DataTables to re-read the information from the data source for the row (be it from the DOM or objects / arrays - whatever the original data source was).\r\n\r\n\t\tInvalidation of data provides an alternative to using `dt-api row().data()` and `dt-api cell().data()` to update cell values. Typically the `data` methods are preferred over the invalidation methods, as they use less code, but where the invalidation methods really shine is when the data source for the table are external objects which can be updated using that objects own methods and then simply tell DataTables that the data has changed by calling the invalidate method.","name":"row().invalidate()","example":[{"content":"\r\nvar table = $('#example').DataTable();\r\nvar tr = $('#example tbody tr:eq(0)');\r\n\r\ntr.find('td:eq(0)').html( 'Updated' );\r\ntable\r\n\t.row( tr )\r\n\t.invalidate()\r\n\t.draw();\r\n","title":"Modify a cell's content using jQuery and then invalidate the row held by DataTables"},{"content":"\r\nvar pupils = [\r\n\tnew Pupil(),\r\n\tnew Pupil(),\r\n\tnew Pupil(),\r\n\tnew Pupil()\r\n];\r\n\r\n// Create table with data set\r\nvar table = $('#example').DataTable( {\r\n\tdata: pupils\r\n} );\r\n\r\n// Modify the data in the data set\r\npupils[0].name( 'Fred Green' );\r\n\r\n// Invalidate and redraw\r\ntable\r\n\t.row( 0 )\r\n\t.invalidate()\r\n\t.draw();\r\n","title":"Using a data object instances and invalidate to update the table after external data changes"}],"since":"1.10","type":{"parameter":{"content":"Data source to read the new data from.\r\n\r\n\t\t\tBy default, DataTables will automatically read the new data for the row from the same source as it was originally read (i.e. DOM sourced or Javascript sourced) but this parameter can be used to override that and tell DataTables specifically which should be used to read in the new data.
