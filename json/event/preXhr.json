{"dt-event":{"summary":"Ajax event - fired before an Ajax request is made","description":"This event is triggered _prior_ to DataTables making an Ajax request to the server for data, and is thus the counterpart to the `dt-event xhr` event which is triggered _after_ the Ajax request has successfully returned data from the server.\r\n\r\n\t\tThe `dt-event preXhr` event is designed for use by plug-in authors who can listen for this event in their extension and send any additional data that might be required. It is very similar to the `dt-init ajax.data` in this ability, with that option typically being used by those writing initialisation code for their table, rather than plug-in authors.\r\n\r\n\t\tPlease note that, as with all DataTables emitted events, this event is triggered with the `dt` namespace. As such, to listen for this event, you must also use the `dt` namespace by simply appending `.dt` to your event name, as shown in the example below.","name":"preXhr","example":{"content":"\r\n$('#example')\r\n\t.on('preXhr.dt', function ( e, settings, data ) {\r\n\t\tdata.sessionId = $('#sessionId').val();\r\n\t} )\r\n\t.dataTable( {\r\n\t\tajax: \"data.json\"\r\n\t} );\r\n\r\n// Note that `ajax.data` could also be used to perform this action in this case\r\n","title":"Send additional data to the server on an Ajax request using an event"},"since":"1.10","type":{"scope":"HTML table element","parameter":[{"content":"jQuery event object","name":"e","type":"object"},{"content":"DataTables settings object","name":"settings","type":"DataTables.Settings"},{"content":"Data that will be sent to the server in an object form","name":"data","type":"object"}],"type":"function","signature":"function( e, settings, json )"},"related":[{"content":"ajax","type":"option"},{"content":"ajax.data","type":"option"},{"content":"ajax.json()","type":"api"},{"content":"xhr","type":"event"}]}}
