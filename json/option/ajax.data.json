{"dt-option":{"summary":"Add or modify data submitted to the server upon an Ajax request","description":"When making an Ajax request to the server, DataTables will construct a data object internally, with the data it requires to be sent to the server for the request. What this data contains will depend upon the processing mode DataTables is operating in:\r\n\r\n\t\t* For client-side processing no additional data is submitted to the server\r\n\t\t* For server-side processing (`dt-init serverSide`) the draw request parameters are submitted - see the [server-side processing manual](//datatables.net/manual/server-side).\r\n\r\n\t\tThe `dt-init ajax.data` option provides the ability to add additional data to the request, or to modify the data object being submitted if required.\r\n\r\n\t\tIn principle it operates in exactly the same way as jQuery's `$.ajax.data` property, in that it can be given as an object with parameters and values to submit, but DataTables extends this by also providing it with the ability to be a function, to allow the data to be re-evaluated upon each Ajax request (see above).","name":"ajax.data","example":[{"content":"\r\n$('#example').dataTable( {\r\n  \"ajax\": {\r\n    \"url\": \"data.json\",\r\n    \"data\": {\r\n    \t\"user_id\": 451\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n} );\r\n","title":"Add an extra parameter (`user_id` in this case), of a static value to the data submitted"},{"content":"\r\n$('#example').dataTable( {\r\n  \"ajax\": {\r\n    \"url\": \"data.json\",\r\n    \"data\": function ( d ) {\r\n    \td.extra_search = $('#extra').val();\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n} );\r\n","title":"Add data to the request by manipulating the data object (no return from the function)"},{"content":"\r\n$('#example').dataTable( {\r\n  \"ajax\": {\r\n    \"url\": \"data.json\",\r\n    \"data\": function ( d ) {\r\n      return $.extend( {}, d, {\r\n        \"extra_search\": $('#extra').val()\r\n      } );\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n} );\r\n","title":"Add data to the request (returning an object)"},{"content":"\r\n$('#example').dataTable( {\r\n  \"ajax\": {\r\n    \"url\": \"data.json\",\r\n    \"contentType\": \"application/json\",\r\n    \"type\": \"POST\",\r\n    \"data\": function ( d ) {\r\n      return JSON.stringify( d );\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n} );\r\n","title":"Submit data as JSON in the request body"}],"since":"1.10","type":[{"description":"As an object, the `dt-init ajax.data` option is used to extend the data object that DataTables constructs internally to submit to the server.

For example, a value could be read from a text input field to act as an additional search option.","returns":{"content":"If there is no return value from the function (i.e. `dt-type undefined`) then the original data object passed into the function by DataTables will be used for the request (the function may have manipulated its values).\r\n\r\n\t\t\tIf an object is returned, then that object will be used as the data for the request. It will not be merged with the original data object constructed by DataTables before being sent.\r\n\r\n\t\t\tIf a string is returned, this string it will be used in the Ajax request body rather than individual HTTP parameters being sent. This is particularly useful for sending JSON encoded data in the request body so the server can decode it directly, rather than individual HTTP parameters being sent.
