{"dt-api":{"summary":"Get / set the ordering applied to the table.","description":"This method provides information and control over the ordering that has been applied to the DataTables in the API's context.\r\n\r\n\t\tOrdering information is stored by DataTables in a 2D array format:\r\n\r\n\t\t```js\r\n\t\t[\r\n\t\t\t[ colIdx_1, orderingDirection_1 ],\r\n\t\t\t[ colIdx_2, orderingDirection_2 ],\r\n\t\t\t...,\r\n\t\t\t[ colIdx_n, orderingDirection_n ]\r\n\t\t]\r\n\t\t```\r\n\r\n\t\twhere `colIdx_x` is the column data index of the column whose data is used to perform the ordering, and `orderingDirection_n` is the direction of the ordering (`dt-string desc` (descending) or `dt-string asc` (ascending)) - note that these _must_ be lower-case. The column index is zero based - i.e. the first column in the table is index `0`, the second index `1` etc.\r\n\r\n\t\tUsing this format, DataTables can achieve single column ordering (i.e. just use one entry in the top level array), or multi-column ordering to the *n*th column (multiple entries in the array).\r\n\r\n\t\tFor convenience, this method allows multi-column ordering to be performed by passing in either multiple 1D ordering arrays or a 2D ordering array. When retrieving the ordering information from the table, a 2D ordering array is always returned.\r\n\r\n\t\tPlease be aware that this method sets the ordering to apply to the table - it does not actually perform the order. In order to have the order performed, use the `dt-api draw()` method, which can be called simply as a chained method of the `dt-api order()` method's returned object - for example `table.order([0, 'desc']).draw();`.","name":"order()","example":[{"content":"\r\nvar table = $('#example').DataTable();\r\nvar order = table.order();\r\n\r\nalert( 'Column '+order[0][0]+' is the ordering column' );\r\n","title":"Get the current ordering of the table"},{"content":"\r\nvar table = $('#example').DataTable();\r\n\r\n// Sort by column 1 and then re-draw\r\ntable\r\n\t.order( [ 1, 'asc' ] )\r\n\t.draw();\r\n","title":"Set the ordering using a 1D array"},{"content":"\r\nvar table = $('#example').DataTable();\r\n\r\n// Sort by columns 1 and 2 and redraw\r\ntable\r\n\t.order( [ 1, 'asc' ], [ 2, 'asc' ] )\r\n\t.draw();\r\n","title":"Set the ordering using multiple 1D arrays to achieve multi-column sorting"},{"content":"\r\nvar table = $('#example').DataTable();\r\n\r\n// Sort by columns 1 and 2 and redraw\r\ntable\r\n\t.order( [[ 1, 'asc' ], [ 2, 'asc' ]] )\r\n\t.draw();\r\n","title":"Use a 2D array to achieve multi-column sorting (matching the example above in functionality)"}],"since":"1.10","type":[{"description":"Get the current ordering of the table.
