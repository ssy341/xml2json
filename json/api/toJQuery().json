This is primarily of use when working with the `nodes()` functions of the API such as `dt-api rows().nodes()`, `dt-api column().nodes()` and  `dt-api cells().nodes()`, where it can be useful to easily convert the API instance into an jQuery object, working with the nodes using the chaining methods provided by jQuery.\r\n\r\n\t\tPlease note that `dt-api to$()` and `dt-api toJQuery()` are identical in functionality. Both methods are provided to cater for the two common forms of how jQuery is used.","name":"toJQuery()","example":{"content":"\r\nvar table = $('#example').DataTable();\r\n\r\ntable\r\n\t.column( 0 )\r\n\t.nodes()\r\n\t.toJQuery()\r\n\t.addClass( 'ready' );\r\n\r\n","title":"Add a class to a specific column in the DataTable"},"since":"1.10","type":{"description":"Create a jQuery object from an API instance.","returns":{"content":"jQuery object which contains the values from the API instance's result set.","type":"jQuery"},"type":"function","signature":"toJQuery()"},"group":"utility"}}
