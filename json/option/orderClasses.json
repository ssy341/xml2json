{"dt-option":{"summary":"Highlight the columns being ordered in the table's body","default":true,"description":"\r\n\t\tDataTables highlight the columns which are used to order the content in the table's body by adding a class to the cells in that column, which in turn has CSS applied to those classes to highlight those cells.\r\n\r\n\t\tThis is done by the addition of the classes `sorting_1`, `sorting_2` and `sorting_3` to the columns which are currently being ordered on. The integer value indicates the level of sorting when mutli-column sorting. If more than 3 columns are being ordered upon, the `sorting_3` class is repeated.\r\n\r\n\t\tPlease note that this feature can affect performance, particularly in old browsers and when there are a lot of rows to be displayed as it is manipulating a large number of DOM elements. As such, this option is available as a feature switch to allow this feature to be disabled with working with old browsers or large data sets.\r\n","name":"orderClasses","example":{"content":"\r\n$('#example').dataTable( {\r\n  \"orderClasses\": false\r\n} );\r\n","title":"Disable column sorting classes"},"since":"1.10","type":{"type":"boolean"},"group":"option","related":[{"content":"ordering","type":"option"},{"content":"order","type":"option"},{"content":"order()","type":"api"}]}}
