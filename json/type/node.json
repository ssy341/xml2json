{"dt-type":{"summary":"DOM element","description":"\r\n\r\nWhen working with the DOM, as is typical in a web-browser using Javascript(!), you will often assign DOM elements to a variable - we define this as a `node` for ease of reference. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar node = document.getElementById('example');\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr with jQuery:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar node = $('#example').get(0);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTechnically this is an `dt-type object` primitive, but defining such objects as a `node` allows the documentation to be much more succinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Use in DataTables\r\n\r\nWhere a parameter is shown as accepting a node type, or a method returning an node type, it indicates that an object is expect / returned which refers to a DOM element.\r\n\r\nNote that `node` refers to the native DOM element, not a jQuery object containing the element. Many DataTables methods will accept both a `node` and a `dt-type jQuery` instance, but this isn't always the case, particularly when considering returned values.\r\n\r\n\t","name":"node","group":"js"}}
