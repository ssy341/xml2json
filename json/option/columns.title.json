{"dt-option":{"summary":"Set the column title","default":"Value read from the column's header cell.","description":"The titles of columns are typically read directly from the DOM (from the cells in the `tag THEAD` element), but it can often be useful to either override existing values, or have DataTables actually construct a header with column titles for you (for example if there is not `tag THEAD` element in the table before DataTables is constructed). This option is available to provide that ability.\r\n\r\n    Please note that when constructing a header, DataTables can only construct a simple header with a single cell for each column. Complex headers with `colspan` and `rowspan` attributes must either already be defined in the document, or be constructed using standard DOM / jQuery methods.","name":"columns.title","example":[{"content":"\r\n$('#example').dataTable( {\r\n  \"columnDefs\": [\r\n    { \"title\": \"My column title\", \"targets\": 0 }\r\n  ]\r\n} );\r\n","title":"Set the first column's title with `dt-init columnDefs`"},{"content":"\r\n$('#example').dataTable( {\r\n  \"columns\": [\r\n    { \"title\": \"My column title\" },\r\n    null,\r\n    null,\r\n    null,\r\n    null\r\n  ]\r\n} );\r\n","title":"Set the first column's title with `dt-init columns`"}],"since":"1.10","type":{"type":"string"},"group":"columns"}}
